## MTB Nodes

Feel free to do whatever you want with this codebase, I'm mainly using Comfy to build POCs to implement in [MLOPs](https://github.com/Bismuth-Consultancy-BV/MLOPs). And a lot of nodes are inspired by existing ones from the community or builtin 
Just beware of the licenses of some libraries (deepbump for instance is [GPLv3](https://github.com/HugoTini/DeepBump/blob/master/LICENSE))

## Install

> **Warning**
> If you use the `python-embed` mode of comfyui (the standalone release) then you might not be able to pip install
> dependencies that don't have wheels, in this case check the last [release](https://github.com/melMass/comfy_mtb/releases) there is a bundle for linux and windows

**Dependencies:**  
From within the python environment you already use for ComfyUI install the requirements.
```bash
pip install -r comfy_mtb/requirements.txt
```
**Models Download:**  
Some nodes require extra models to be downloaded, you can interactively do it using the same python environment as above:
```bash
python scripts/download_models.py
```

then follow the prompt or just press enter to download every models.

On first run the script [tries to symlink](https://github.com/melMass/comfy_mtb/blob/d982b69a58c05ccead9c49370764beaa4549992a/__init__.py#L45-L61) the web extensions to your comfy `web/extensions` folder. In case it fails you can manually copy the web scripts it only provides a color widget for now:

You should also see the nodes that failed loading with the reason next to them.

### Node List
In the JS Side a new widget type is added: COLOR, for now both the input and the widget are exposed, the input takes precendence over the widget.


**misc utils**  
- `Text To Image`: Utils to convert text to image using a font
- `Styles Loader`: Load csv files and populate a dropdown from the rows (Ã  la A111)
- `Smart Step`: A very basic node to get step percent to use in KSampler advanced,
- `Qr Code`: Basic QR Code generator
- `Save Tensors`: Debug node that will probably be removed in the future
- `Int to Number`: Supplement for WASSuite number nodes

**face detection / swapping**
- `Face Swap`: Face swap using deepinsight/insightface models (this node used to be called `Roop` in early versions, it does the same)
  
**latent**  
- `Latent Lerp`: Linear interpolation (blend) between two latent 


**bbox**
- `Bounding Box`: BBox constructor (custom type),
- `BBox From Mask`: From a mask extract the bounding box
- `Crop`: Crop image from BBox
- `Uncrop`: Uncrop image from BBox

- `Blur`: Blur an image using a Gaussian filter.
- `Denoise`: Denoise the input image,
- `Image Compare`: Compare two images and return a difference image
- `Deglaze Image`: taken from [FN16](https://github.com/Fannovel16/FN16-ComfyUI-nodes/blob/main/DeglazeImage.py),
- `Mask To Image`: Converts a mask (alpha) to an RGB image with a color and background
- `Image Premultiply`: Premultiply image with mask
- `Image Resize Factor`: Extracted mostly from [WAS Node Suite](https://github.com/WASasquatch/was-node-suite-comfyui), with a few edits (most notably multiple image support) and less features.
- `Save Image Grid`: Save all the images in the input batch as a grid of images.

## Screenshots

- **FaceSwap (formely named roop)** (using [insight-face](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface))  
  The face index allow you to choose which face to replace as you can see here:
